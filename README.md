# Spring-Framework-5.0-Spring-Inversion-of-Control---XML-Configuration-
The approach of outsourcing the construction and management of objects.
Inversion of Control (IOC) makes the code loosely coupled. 
In such case, there is no need to modify the code if our logic is moved to new environment.
In Spring framework, IOC container is responsible to inject the dependency. 
We provide metadata to the IOC container either by XML file or annotation.
